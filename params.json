  "body": "# StEVE - A Static Data Access API for EVE Online\r\n\r\nStEVE is intended to ease the development for EVE Online and it's Static Data \r\nExport (SDE). StEVE provides a high-level API to access the SDE data without \r\nhaving to know much about the data is structured internally.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1- Download the source code: \r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/PageArkanis/StEVE\r\n\r\n2- build and install:\r\n\r\n    cd StEVE\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\n\r\n## Running StEVE\r\n\r\nFirst time StEVE is imported it will fetch the SDE from https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/sqlite-latest.sqlite. \r\nAfterwards it will only fetch a new version once its available but will check \r\nfor it every time a program is started. Without an Internet connection it will\r\nthrow a warning but will continue to work.\r\n\r\nSet *SDE_DB_DIR* to a directory in your environment to use this directory as the\r\nSDE database directory. This saves from downloading SDE if you run multiple \r\nversions of StEVE. \r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n\r\n    from steve import Assets, Universe\r\n    \r\n    # print Tritanium ID\r\n    print Assets.type['Tritanium'].uid\r\n\r\n    # print Name for ID 34\r\n    print Assets.type[34].name\r\n\r\n    # print Jita ID\r\n    print Universe.system['Jita'].uid\r\n\r\n    # print System Name for ID \r\n    print Universe.system[30000142].name\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy hacking!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSee [COPYING](https://github.com/PageArkanis/StEVE/blob/master/COPYING) for licensing info.\r\n",
